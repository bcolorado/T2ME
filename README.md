# T2ME

This is a workshop for the course "Stochastic Models" at Universidad Nacional de Colombia.

## Description

1. Program designed in C++ programming language for simulating M/M/1 queueing systems. This program can be used to perform various experiments and can be easily extended to other types of models.

2. Variable names were changed from English to Spanish.

3. The input file "mm1.in" was changed to "param.txt" (for clarity and easy modification of input parameters).

4. The output file "mm2.out" was changed to "result.txt" (for easier reading of statistics).

5. The file "lcgrand.cpp" was taken from http://www.sju.edu/~sforman/courses/2000F_CSC_5835/, which is a simulations website. Look for the Simlib.c link (a simulation library).

## Installation

To execute the simulation, it is necessary to install the C++ programming language and use an IDE for proper execution. Additionally, all files stored in the repository must be downloaded and ensured that they are in the same folder.

## Usage


To execute the simulation, the main.cpp file must be run.
